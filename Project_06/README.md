PROJECT NAME:	Predicting Emergency Room Utilization using Logistic Regression  
AUTHORS:	Madhukar Ayachit, Kouevi Dosseh-Adjanon, Ryan Long

NUMBER OF FILES:	4  

OBJECTIVE:	The problem to be evaluated will focus specifically on Emergency Room (ER) utilization data to help build a predictive Logistic Regression model to understand the likelihood of a patient returning to the ER more than 4 times per year. This proposed solution is the development and deployment of a machine learning model with the goal to predict patients who are likely to over-utilize the emergency room or have more than 4 ER visits in a year. It could be a step towards proactively redirecting patients ahead of time towards lower costing medical services.
