# RPL's Data Science Portfolio

## About
This webpage contains links to various data science projects accumulated over the past few years highlighting work I've performed. Projects range in complexity but span general data science topics such as programming and modeling to visualizations and presentations. Python, R, Power BI were the langagues and programs primarily used throughout the development of the below listing of projets.

### Project 1
Female Middle School Cross Country Performance Prediction Using Multiple Regression - Python  
The objective of this project is to predict running pace of a youth cross country participant using a model to calculate a pace (dependent) given several criteria (independent) obtained from seasonal data of a female middle school cross-country season. This information will aid runners, coaches, and parents to focus on healthy and holistic training outcomes.
