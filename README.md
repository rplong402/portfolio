# RPL's Data Science Portfolio

## About
This webpage contains links to various data science projects accumulated over the past few years highlighting work I've performed. Projects range in complexity but span general data science topics such as programming and modeling to visualizations and presentations. Python, R, Power BI were the langagues and programs primarily used throughout the development of the below listing of projets.

### Project 1
**Female Middle School Cross Country Performance Prediction Using Multiple Regression - Python**  
  
The objective of this project is to predict running pace of a youth cross country participant using a model to calculate a pace (dependent) given several criteria (independent) obtained from seasonal data of a female middle school cross-country season. This information will aid runners, coaches, and parents to focus on healthy and holistic training outcomes.

### Project 2
**Predicting Fraud with XGBoost - Python**  
  
The objective of this project is to use an XGBoost model to predict fraudulent credit card transactions to prevent losses to financial institutions.

### Project 6
**Predicting Emergency Room Utilization using Logistic Regression - Python & R**  

The problem to be evaluated will focus specifically on Emergency Room (ER) utilization data to help build a predictive Logistic Regression model to understand the likelihood of a patient returning to the ER more than 4 times per year. This proposed solution is the development and deployment of a machine learning model with the goal to predict patients who are likely to over-utilize the emergency room or have more than 4 ER visits in a year. It could be a step towards proactively redirecting patients ahead of time towards lower costing medical services.

### Project 8
**Data Visualization Storytelling - Python, R, PowerBI, PowerPoint, Canva**  

Use data visualizations to communicate internally and externally a mock challenge of an airline faced by media reports of unsafe air travel. The following were created: Internal facing dashboard, executive presentation, blog post, infographic, and short audio/visual presentation.

### Project 9
**Health Data Analysis in R Data Visualization Examples**  

Two contributing factors related to maintaining body weight are physical activity and eating nutritious foods. The question is to what degree does individual choices regarding physical activity and quality of nutrition aid the effort to prevent obesity?

### Project 10
**Weather Forecast Program - Python**  

User selects either zip code, city, or stops the program. Next prompt asks user to input either zip or city, program then checks format. Then requests weather data from OpenWeatherMap.org using API request and displays pertinent weather in readable format. Request function also checks the connection to OpenWeatherMap.org. User than can either repeat or stop the program. Usage: Select either zip code, city, or stop. Input either zip or city, can be repeated until stopped by user.
