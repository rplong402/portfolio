# RPL's Data Science Portfolio

## About
This webpage contains links to various data science projects accumulated over the past few years highlighting I've performed. Projects range in complexity but cover a range from programming and modeling to visualizations and presentations. Python, R, Power BI were the langagues and programs were primarily used throughout the development of the below listing of projets.
